# Merry ModJam 2020
Welcome to Merry ModJam, the Christmas Mod Jam for Fabric 1.16.4!
This is a community event in order to bring out the best of the Fabric Modloader! Here is all the information.

## Join our Discord
You should join our Discord server in order to submit your mod and take part. Your mod must be submitted in the #submissions channel. It will not count otherwise. <br>
Our Discord can be found at [this location.](https://mmj2020.tk/discord)

## Mod Rules
- The mod must be Christmas themed or related to the holiday season in some way.
- The mod must be for Fabric 1.16.4
- The mod must be uploaded to either:
     - Modrinth, with "MMJ -" at the start of the mod name (https://modrinth.com/)
     - GitHub, with the tag merry-mod-jam-2020.
- We will not accept submissions that are on other platforms.
- The mod must be safe for work and not contain any content which would break the Discord Community Guidelines, or the rules in #rules.
- You may work in a team, but your team can consist of no more than 4 members, 3 of which can be devs. You may have as many artists as you like, and devs can also be artists.
- You may not plan, code or design the mod until the window has started.
- You may use existing assets with permission.
## Guidelines
- Try to make a specific mod rather than a general one, don't overstretch
- Try to make something creative which will please the judges
- Please avoid having dependencies other than Fabric API, jar-in-jar them if possible.
## How This Works
The event begins on the 21st of December at midday (GMT).
From then until midnight on the 1st of January, 2021 (GMT).
All of the work on your mod, both design and coding, must be done within this window.
The mod must be submitted by the end date or it will not count.
From that point, until the 3rd of January, the Judges will nominate mods for a variety of categories, and then the community will vote on which mod wins.
The mod winners will be announced on the 9th of January.
